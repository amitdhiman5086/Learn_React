## npx == npm run //means npm install the package and run executes it ,, npx execute the installed pacakge.

Sure, let's simplify and explain each concept in a way that you can easily discuss in an interview. I'll also provide examples where relevant.

### Theory Assignment:

1. **What is `NPM`?**
   - **NPM**: Node Package Manager.
   - **Purpose**: Manages JavaScript packages (libraries).
   - **Example**: Installing React using `npm install react`.

2. **What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?**
   - **Parcel/Webpack**: Tools to bundle JavaScript files and dependencies.
   - **Need**: Optimize code, manage dependencies, and improve loading speed.
   - **Example**: Using Parcel to bundle a React app into a single file.

3. **What is `.parcel-cache`?**
   - **.parcel-cache**: Directory used by Parcel to store cached data.
   - **Purpose**: Speeds up the build process by reusing previous results.
   - **Example**: Reduces build time on subsequent runs.

4. **What is `npx`?**
   - **npx**: Tool to execute packages from the npm registry.
   - **Purpose**: Run packages without installing them globally.
   - **Example**: Running create-react-app with `npx create-react-app my-app`.

5. **What is the difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?**
   - **dependencies**: Packages needed for the app to run.
   - **devDependencies**: Packages needed only for development.
   - **Example**: `react` in dependencies, `jest` (testing library) in devDependencies.

6. **What is Tree Shaking?**
   - **Tree Shaking**: Removing unused code from the final bundle.
   - **Purpose**: Reduce bundle size.
   - **Example**: Only including used functions from a utility library.

7. **What is Hot Module Replacement (HMR)?**
   - **HMR**: Updates modules in the browser without a full reload.
   - **Purpose**: Faster development and retains app state.
   - **Example**: Updating CSS without losing the current state of the app.

8. **List down your favorite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.**
   - **Favorites**: Fast bundling, Zero configuration, HMR, Tree shaking, Asset management.
   - **Descriptions**:
     - **Fast bundling**: Quick build process due to parallel processing.
     - **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box, no setup needed.
     - **HMR**: Instant updates without losing the state of the app.

9. **What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?**
   - **.gitignore**: File to specify untracked files in Git.
   - **Add**: node_modules, build files.
   - **Don't add**: Source code, configuration files.

10. **What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?**
    - **package.json**: Lists project metadata and dependencies.
    - **package-lock.json**: Locks exact versions of dependencies.
    - **Purpose**: Ensure consistent installs.

11. **Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?**
    - **Reason**: Ensures stability and consistency of dependencies.
    - **Risk**: Manual changes can break the app.

12. **What is `node_modules`? Is it a good idea to push that on git?**
    - **node_modules**: Directory for installed packages.
    - **Not on git**: Too large and can be recreated.
    - **Example**: Generated by running `npm install`.

13. **What is the `dist` folder?**
    - **dist**: Distribution folder for production-ready files.
    - **Purpose**: Contains minified and optimized files.
    - **Example**: Final output after building the project.

14. **What is `browserslist`?**
    - **browserslist**: Specifies browser support for tools.
    - **Purpose**: Ensure compatibility.
    - **Example**: "> 1%, last 2 versions" targets recent browsers.

### Project Assignment:

1. **Initialize `npm` in your repo:**
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```
   - **Example**: Sets up `package.json`.

2. **Install `react` and `react-dom`:**
   ```sh
   npm install react react-dom
   ```
   - **Example**: Adds React to your project.

3. **Remove CDN links of React:**
   - **Action**: Delete React scripts from HTML.
   - **Example**: Use local React instead of online version.

4. **Install Parcel:**
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev parcel
   ```
   - **Example**: Adds Parcel as a development dependency.

5. **Ignite your app with Parcel:**
   - **Scripts**: Add to `package.json`:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "parcel index.html",
       "build": "parcel build index.html"
     }
     ```
   - **Example**: Run `npm start` to develop and `npm run build` for production.

6. **Add `.gitignore` file:**
   - **Content**:
     ```
     node_modules
     .parcel-cache
     dist
     ```
   - **Example**: Prevents unnecessary files from being tracked by Git.

7. **Add `browserslist`:**
   - **Content**:
     ```json
     "browserslist": [
       "> 1%",
       "last 2 versions"
     ]
     ```
   - **Example**: Ensures your code runs on specified browsers.

8. **Build a production version of your code using `parcel build`:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   - **Example**: Generates optimized files in `dist` folder.

By breaking down these steps and concepts into simple points with examples, you'll be able to explain them clearly in an interview. If you need more detailed explanations or have any specific questions, feel free to ask!
